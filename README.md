## Instructions

# 1. Creation of the NodeJS web application

## HInstallation

  This app is written with Nodejs and uses Redis database.
  
  1 - [install NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  
  2 - [install REDIS](https://redis.io/download)
  
  3 - Install application

Go to the [user-api](./user-api/) directory of the application (where `package.json` file located) and run:

  ```bash
  npm install 
  ```

## Use the application
  1 - start a sever
  
  From the [user-api](./user-api/) directory of the repository, run:

```bash
npm run start
```
    
<http://localhost:3000> should be accessible and our web application will run (make sure to have the Redis server open):

* To create a user, send the curl POST request to the application with the user data:

```bash
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{"username":"cconchez", "firstname":"clement", "lastname":"conchez"}' \
  http://localhost:3000/user
```
It should output:

```bash
{"status":"success","msg":"OK"}
```  

After, if you go to <http://localhost:3000/user/cconchez>, with "cconchez" being the username that you had in your POST data, it will display in the browser the following, with correspondance to the data that you posted:  

```bash
{"status":"success","msg":{"firstname":"clement","lastname":"conchez"}}
```

You can also use POST, GET , UPDDATE and DELETE.

## Test the application 

Go to the [user-api](./user-api/) directory of the application (where `package.json` file located) and run:

```bash
npm run test
``` 
All 12 tests should be passed :
